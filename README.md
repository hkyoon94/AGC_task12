# AGC task 1, 2

### Project for '2022 AI Grand Challenge', task 1 and 2.

1. inference/ directory contains solving routines for task 1 and 2.

2. mod/ directory contains whole pipeline of task 1 and 2, for both submission and testing.

3. models/ directory contains sub-routines using transformer models (sentence-BERT, MRC) for solving routines in inference/ directory.

4. main.py handles the master pipeline for submission.

#### *** NOTE: main.py, models/mrc_infer, models/mrc_infer2, inference/tree_builder.py, inference/task2_routines, inference/task2_form_mapping.py, and inference/unit_form.py is NOT written by me alone. ***
